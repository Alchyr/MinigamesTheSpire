# Introduction:
It is this time of year again, the third year since Kiooeht blessed the modding scene with Mod the Spire. That's right, 18/01/2021 marked the third year of modding the spire, so a lot of the members of the modding discord came together and made something for everybody to enjoy.

# Description:
Minigames the Spire adds an event that can spawn in any act, you'll get the choice between 3 randomly selected from a variety of minigames we made. These range from Fishing to solving a Rubix Cube and take somewhere around 30-60 seconds to beat.  
  
Play them, win and gain prizes to help you on your trip through the spire!

[i]If you wish to only explore the minigames feel free to use the Basemod console and use the "event minigames:Test" command.[/i]

If you find bugs or think something could use another balance pass, don't hesitate to let us know. It's hard to balance a game if you made it yourself, who would've thought.
