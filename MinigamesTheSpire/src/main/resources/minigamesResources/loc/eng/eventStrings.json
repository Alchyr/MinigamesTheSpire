For subsequent tiles that are flipped that have the number #b1, #b1 is added to the player's score. Flipping a #rGremlin #rNob causes the player to spill all #ygold and #plose the minigame. NL NL Numbers next to the Nob denote how many Nobs are on that row, and numbers in the top right denote the sum of the numbers in the row. NL Press left-click to flip a tile. NL Press right-click to mark a tile.",
